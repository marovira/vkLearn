# vkLearn

Learning how to Vulkan with `vulkan-hpp`. 

The goal of this repository is to learn how to use the Vulkan API with the
provided C++ wrapper. It is based on the
[vulkan-tutoral](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) and adapted to use `vulkan-hpp`.
The code is structured to follow the "chapters" of the tutorial, having one
folder per chapter. This allows a more visual tracking of the evolution of the
code, as well as test each thing independently while still retaining the
foundation of the previous chapter.

Note that **no** effort is done to wrap Vulkan in any way. This is just for
learning purposes.
